
-> It is a simple implementation of chatbot using PyTorch
-> Here, feed forward neural network is used with hidden layers
-> A basic UI design is made for better visualisation
-> The important packages used here are: PyTorch, nltk, numpy and tkinter
-> Pytorch installation: Go to console and run pip install torch
-> numpy installation: Go to console and run pip install numpy
-> tkinter installation: Go to console and run pip install tk
-> nltk installation: Go to console and run pip install nltk. Then run nltk.download(). After that choose all and click download
-> Before running the code, at least once, the statement nltk.download('punkt') should be run. 
-> This should be run single time only,after it is downloaded, no need to run it again later
-> Jupyter notebook is used for running the entire code
-> Name of our dataset is intents.json
